## 📚 Description

This layout uses basic HTML & CSS to build a two-column layout:

- **<aside>**: A sticky sidebar containing 2 colored widgets
- **<article>**: Main content filled with multiple paragraphs to simulate scroll behavior
- The sidebar uses position: sticky with top: 2rem, so it stays visible after scrolling down
